# *Guide*

#charge - gets "energy" to use other attacks
#shield - shields you from any attack except megaball
#fireball - requires 1 charge to use and you beat the opponent if they use charge
#iceball - requires 2 charges to use and it can kill fireball and charge
#megaball - requires 5 charges and when you use it you instantly win 
#unless your opponent uses megaball too 

#click the "run" button to start the game|
#what the computer does is COMPLETELY randomized
#it will keep asking you for input (where you enter your move) and it keeps going 
#until someone wins 
#the numbers are how many charges you and the computer have

#tell me if you find any bugs
